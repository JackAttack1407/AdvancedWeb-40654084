use css to make the text a good color for the raid guides and lore pagse as some of them currently dont show up well

update guides and lore csv with data from word doc on desktop

create data for classes.csv, and add it to the csv

add refs to refs.csc, use og design documents as it has some links

create an executable python file so i dont have to keep typing out the uv run flask --app etc etc

add graphs and diagrams from og coursework submission doc links (maybe)


use css to make it look nice, update the classes for all div's so they use the css eg - container1
