the raids guides differs from the lore pages csv handling system as for the raid guide i wanted it to be navigated by button
however, for the lore pages i wanted a wall of text, this however created csv strings too large for it to handle, so i used papa parse

this was only used for this section and the classes section as before this the, bits of string where not large enough to cause issues
